	<h1>Survivor is an American Television show that aired in 2000. Jeff Probst hosts it. He is also the executive producer. There are currently 45 seasons. They place a group of strangers in an isolated location and they have to fend for themselves. They have little food, no fire, and no shelter. 

<h1>The game idea is completing challenges to see who the sole survivor is. These challenges test their physical and mental abilities. You may have to run and swim or do puzzles and endurance activities. By winning that you achieve immunity and your teammates cannot vote you out. Every 3 days you go to a place called a tribal council and you talk about the past few days and you each vote a player out. You have to make it on the island for 39 days. When you have made it to the final 3 or 2 all the members who have been previously voted out come back and vote on the Sole Survivor. With that title, you also receive 1 million dollars.
